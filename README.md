# IntPrep – React Interview Playground 🚀

A focused React practice app designed to help explain key front-end concepts clearly in live interviews. Each page showcases a different pattern — from API fetches to controlled inputs — built with simplicity, reusability, and accessibility in mind.

## 🎯 Purpose

This isn’t just a demo app — it’s a **talk-through tool**. I use this to:

- Practice live explanations of core React concepts
- Walk through real code confidently in interviews
- Showcase thoughtful component design and UI logic

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- `useState` and controlled components
- `useEffect` with async API fetches
- Reusable layout with `BetterCard`
- Conditional rendering and loading states
- Route-based component views
- Styled components with accessibility in mind

## 💡 Future Additions

- Custom React hooks (`useForm`, `useFetch`)
- Basic test coverage with Jest
- Error boundaries and graceful fallbacks
- Auth-protected routes (OAuth login mock)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- React (functional components + hooks)
- React Router
- CSS / inline styles / scoped classes
- Clean, readable structure for fast walkthroughs

## 🚧 Status

Still evolving — this is an **active WIP** used for live demo and learning.  
_“Please excuse the mess — under construction 🚧”_
